📊 SalesOrdersAnalysis

Sales Order Data Exploration, Cleaning and Manipulation using Python

This project analyzes ERP-exported sales order data and transforms transactional records into structured analytical feature layers.

🎯 Goals

Separate realized revenue from pipeline exposure

Quantify revenue concentration

Evaluate execution reliability

Measure financial exposure

Engineer reusable order-, customer-, and sales-rep-level features

The project emphasizes business-aware data handling and operational analytics.

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Notebook: 01_data_exploration_cleaning.ipynb

Steps performed:

Loaded ERP-exported dataset (CSV)

Corrected data types (dates, numeric fields)

Removed non-analytical fields (CRM metadata, remarks, unused attributes)

Handled missing execution dates using business logic

Removed duplicates using order-level business keys

Preserved signed financial values

Positive balance → customer owes

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Notebook: 02_Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb

💰 Revenue Structure

Separated executed vs draft orders

Quantified realized revenue vs pipeline exposure

📊 Revenue Concentration

Ranked customers by total revenue

Identified right-skewed distribution

Confirmed concentration risk

📦 Order Value Distribution

Heavy right skew in order totals

Large orders disproportionately impact totals

👤 Sales Rep Analysis

Execution rate by sales rep

Pipeline exposure by rep

Financial exposure ratios

Fulfillment gap frequency

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Notebook: 03_Feature_Engineering.ipynb

Order-level features

Customer-level features

Sales-rep-level features

🔎 Key Findings

Revenue is highly right-skewed.

A small subset of customers drives a disproportionate share of total revenue.

Execution reliability varies across sales reps.

Financial exposure is unevenly distributed.

Fulfillment gaps represent operational friction rather than customer behavior.

🛠 Technologies Used
